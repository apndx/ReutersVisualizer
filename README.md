# [ReutersVisualizer](https://reuters-visualizer.herokuapp.com/)
This project is for the Helsinki University Interactive data visualization course.

The visualizations are based on the [Reuters Corpora](https://trec.nist.gov/data/reuters/reuters.html) document topics in the CD 2. The articles are from year 1997. I was inspired to explore the data more thoroughly through visualization while I was using the corpus in developing [a document classifier](https://github.com/apndx/ReutersDocLabeler).
